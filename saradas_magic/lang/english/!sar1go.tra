@200=~I'm tired of wasting my time with you!  My only hope is that you have learned the lesson and that you will not commit more evil deeds!  Begone!~

Fear not, young ones, it's not permanent.  It will last just enough to make you refrain from stealing again... and from eating chicken feed.  Go now!~
