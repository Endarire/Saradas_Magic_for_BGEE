School: Evocation
Level: 7
Range: 30'
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Spell negates (-5 penalty)

When you cast this spell, you make a small luminescent sphere in your hands, ready to be thrown at the target.  When it touches the target creature, it triggers an immense column of flame that surrounds it, causing terrible burns.

A creature that fails its save vs. spell is knocked prone and takes 8d10 fire damage.  A successful save negates being knocked prone and reduces the fire damage to 5d10.  Regardless, the target continues to burn for 3 rounds, taking 5 fire damage per round with no additional save.~

//Spell Drain was renamed Spell Siphon for clarity.  It also feels overpriced, since with the same spell slot I can just cast something to directly end the fight sooner and sleep off the damage.  To me, this seems fair as a level 1 or 2 spell to give characters more spell uses when they need them most.
@5 = ~Spell Siphon~
@6 = ~Spell Siphon
School: Enchantment
Level: 7
Range: 7'
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Spell negates (-5 penalty)

The caster attacks the opponent's mind to make him forget two memorized spell if he fails a saving throw vs. spell at a -5 penalty, restoring one of his own.  Spell Siphon affects spells from levels 1 to 9, but it will attempt to steal the highest level spell of this target first and restore the same level of spell to you.

This spell affects only sorcerers and wizards including dual-classed and multiclassed ones.  This spell has no effect on other creatures, even if they fail their save.

This spell is quite famous among some sorcerers.  It was used many time in a past era in the settling of scores between magicians, with the intent to ridicule the opponent. It's definitely one of the most devastating spells to use against a magician.  Saradas was one of the most powerful and renowned masters in Faerun and he used to entertain himself to use this spell, which he invented, on unsuspecting students, to make the exams much more difficult.~

@7=~Spell Siphon: You recovered a spell.~

//I assumed Lashing Wind also worked like Wing Buffet in that it dispersed cloud effects.  Like other Saradas spells, this too felt overpriced and, to me, feels like a strong spell for level 2 and a moderate-to-weak spell for level 3.
@8=~Lashing Wind~
@9=~Lashing Wind
School: Evocation
Level: 6
Range: 15'
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Line in front of caster
Saving Throw: Spell negates (+2 bonus)


With a single gesture of his hand the caster evokes a powerful gust of wind capable of knocking out an entire group of enemies.  Enemies in range are thrown 20' away from the caster, and if they fail a saving throw vs. spell at a -2 penalty, they also suffer 1d10 bludgeoning damage, they drop weapons they hold in their hands, and are 
stunned for 1 round due to the sudden wind force.

This gust of wind is also strong enough to disperse lingering cloud effects such as Cloudkill.

Friendly creatures are unaffected by this spell.~

//Gravitational Field again feels overpriced.  Slow is already a somewhat useful level 3 spell that lasts longer but doesn't disarm nor directly reduce creature stats.  At level 3, Gravitational Field - even with its +2 bonus on its save - seems like a plausible competitor to the more reliably applied but less directly powerful Slow.  Give Gravitational Field a -2 save or more severe penalty and it's plausibly worthy of a level 4 or 5 spell slot.
@10=~Gravitational Field~
@11=~Gravitational Field
School: Alteration
Level: 5
Range: 20'
Duration: 15 seconds
Target: 1 creature
Casting Time: 5
Saving Throw: Spell negates (+2 bonus)

This spell increases the force of gravity in an area decided by the caster.  Each hostile creature in the area of effect must succeed a saving throw vs spell at a +2 bonus or be overwhelmed by a sudden increase in gravity, thus dropping their weapons on the ground because of their unsustainable weight.  In addition, they are slowed as per a Slow spell and their DEX score is halved.  Like most effects, the effects of this spell can be dispelled.

Friendly creatures are unaffected by this spell.~

//Formerly Spiritual Explosion, Plasma Beam was renamed something more Evocation-themed and its mechanics were clarified and streamlined.

School: Evocation
Level: Epic
Range: 75'
Duration: Instantaneous
Target: 1 creature
Casting Time: Instant
Saving Throw: Spell half (-7 penalty)

Plasma Beam deals d10+1 magic energy damage per caster level to a maximum of 20d10+1.  A successful save vs. spell at a -7 penalty halves this damage.

This spell ignores spell resistance and overcomes protective barriers.

This spell also causes the caster to be fatigued for 1 hour after casting.

This is the most potent offensive spell devised and taught by Saradas, the Blue Wizard.  The caster focuses an immense energy in its hands, including a fraction of his life energy.~

//I renamed Flawless Teleport to Into Thin Air because of its teleport effect combined with invisibility:  Someone seems to vanish into thin air.  This is the most balanced spell Saradas made so far!

//Tenser's Supremacy by default is NOT worth a level 9 spell.  I would much rather use Time Stop or Summon Planetar or Chain Contingency with that spell slot, even on a Fighter/Mage.

-Immune to blindness, charm, confusion, death effects, disease, disintegration, domination, fear, feeblemind, level drain, petrification, poison, polymorph other, sleep, and stun.

-Immune (+100% resistance) to cold and electricity.

-Can only be harmed by weapons that strike as +3 or greater.

+75% electricity resistance.

-Continuously surrounded by a 30' fear aura.  Foes in 30' must save vs. spell each round or be panicked for 1 round.

-You can use the Lich Touch innate ability at will.  This is an instantaneous ability that ignores spell resistance.

This magic natural weapon counts as a +5 weapon, improves your THAC0 by 5, does d10+5 piercing damage damage & 2d6 cold damage per hit, and heals you for d6 HP per hit.  Whenever a creature is hit with this Lich Touch, the subject must save vs. death at a -2 penalty or be paralyzed for 10 rounds.~

//It's an interesting idea but my revised version is below.  (The base version is about equivalent to a level 1 OlvynSpell!)

@45=~Shroud of Wild Magic
School: Wild Magic
Level: Epic
Range: 20'
Duration: 10 rounds
Casting Time: Instant
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Breath negates (-3 penalty)

When you cast this spell, a foe that fails its save vs. breath at a -3 penalty will automatically trigger wild surges for any spell it casts within the aura for its duration.  As is the nature of wild magic, these wild surges may be harmful, helpful, or neutral to their casters.

This Shroud of Wild Magic can't be dispelled.

One must also keep in mind that even a grand master shall never fully control this type of magical energy.~
